	<p>The creator’s of the ad “Hayward Magic” employs logos, pathos,
	 ethos, chronos, and where the advertisement is found to invoke appeal in the 2021 Olympics.
	</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;">What is Hayward field?</h3>
	<p >To understand this ad, one must first have some background 
		on Hayward Field, and through this knowledge the creators utilyze logos. Hayward Field
		 is the track and field stadium at the University of Oregon in Eugene, better known as 
		 TrackTown USA. The area has been dubbed this for it’s many legends within the track 
		 community it has produced  as well as the birthplace of nike. For example, debatably 
		 one of the best long distance runners of all time, olympian, and at some point American 
		 record holder, Steve Preofontaine collegiately competed at the University of Oregon. 
		 Prefontaine was coached by Bill Bowerman. Bowerman himself led the Ducks of Oregon to win
		countless titles and produced 31 Olympic athletes as well as co-founded nike. Moreover, 
		 with such a rich history in track and field taken place within Hayward’s stadium, Hayward
		 field has become a legendary track for runners to race on. Many runners not only dream 
		 to compete, but let alone step foot upon the rubber of this simplistic 400 meter oval.
		 Through this location’s deep history for the sport, the creators establish logos; furthermore, 
		increasing the viewer’s likelihood of supporting and watching the 2021 Olympic trials.
		 Moreover, if the trials are held at a prestigious and “fast” track, it is logical that 
		fast times will be produced; therefore, it would be disappointing to miss the races.</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;">What does “Hayward Magic” mean? </h3>
	<p>As seen through their mission, the creators are able to employ
	 pathos. According to their website <a href=" https://haywardmagic.com"> https://haywardmagic.com</a> 
	 Hayward Magic is an organization whose goal is to “Use the magic of Hayward Field to captivate 
	 the hearts of a new generation of track & field athletes and fans”. Moreover, the creators 
	 behind this ad utilize pathos to inspire others’ to gravitate towards track and field-specially 
	 the 2021 Olympic trials. To understand how the creators do this, one must first understand the ad 
	 completely.
	</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Ad Breakdown</h3>
	<p>The ad begins by a runner competing in the trials midway
		 through at a rough position within the race, and following through to finish while
		 crowds cheer and an announcer narrates the specital. This represents the glory of 
		 finishing and the amazing sight to see as a runner does well in competition. 
		For both a spectator and a competitor, the magic of Hayward field is visible. However, 
		this runner does not go to halt as he crosses the line, he runs off the track into the 
		street directly into pouring rain, to a rainbow, to sunshine, through an autumn park, 
		through a snowstorm and children playing, through a campsite as the sun sets while others
		 relax by a campfire, to through a desert as the sun rises, even crossing over route 66 
		while a buffalo runs at his side, avoiding a train, he runs through a community encaptured 
		at an eclipse- eyes away from him, and back into the streets of Eugene as he heads back 
		to into the stadium. During this all, the runner grows a beard and long hair and chops 
		it all right before he goes back in. 
		</p>
		<p>This represents the passage of time. Through all the seasons
		 spring, summer, then fall, and winter and the worst of conditions snowstorms and desert heat,
		 the runner continues training. While everyone is distracted looking at the eclipse he continues 
		training. Through night and day he continues training. This emphasizes the magic at Hayward, but
		 reminds the viewers that the spectacular events are built outside the stadium therefore invoking
		 pathos. Moreover, this encourages people to watch athletes compete with months/years of hard work
		 in the making and they get excited for these events.</p>

	
	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Time and Place</h3>
	<p>Furthermore, the creators employ chronos in order to properly
		 gain attraction to the trails. The ad is presented around a month before the trials take
		 place. However, it is important to recognize that people generally become more interested
		 in sports pre-Olympics; therefore, interest in track and field begins to spike during
		 this time. Keeping this in mind, if the advertisement reaches people who do not already
		 have a large interest in the sport outside of the Olympics, then the creators of this ad
		 will be more likely to achieve their goal in spiking interest in the sport. However,
		 if the ad reaches individuals who are already invested in track and field, then they will
		 be more aware of the Olympic trials being held at Hayward field. By fans of the sport being
		 aware of the trials, it further increases traction to the trials. In turn, both instances
		 create more attention to the sport. 
	</p>
	<p>In addition, where the ad can be found is key to the success of
		 reaching the organization’s ideal demographic. The creator’s employ modern media, specifically
		 instagram to reach their goal- inspire new generations to peak interest in track and field-
		 due to the notion that most instagram users are young. Without utilizing the media source,
		 the creators may not be able to reach the ideal audience; therefore, not gaining appeal. 
	</p>
	<p> To add, because the advertisement was released through the official
		 Hayward Magic instagram page, it establishes ethos. This is also coupled with the history of
		 Hayward itself. For example, if a random college hosted the Olympic trials, for example Lewis
		 University, the University’s track lacks a substantial amount of track and field history.
		 In turn, people may not trust that the trials are being held there or not care as much due to
		 its lack of history. In addition, Ads on social media applications can be hit or miss credibility-wise,
		 and the account is very reliable because it comes from the University of Oregon itself. Therefore,
		 viewers may gain trust and be persuaded to watch more and believe that the advertisement contains
		 truthful information. Moreover, influencing viewers to watch the trails and peak interest
		 in the sport itself.
	</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Conclusions</h3>
	<p>All in all, the creators of the advertisement “Hayward Magic” promote the 2021 Olympic trials by utilizing logos, pathos, ethos, chronos, and where the advertisement is found. </p>
